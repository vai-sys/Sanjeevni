      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Insomnia is a common sleep disorder that can make it difficult to fall asleep, stay asleep, or get restful sleep. Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, offers natural remedies for insomnia that can help you get the restful sleep you need. Here are some Ayurvedic remedies for insomnia that you can try.

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        According to Ayurveda, maintaining a regular sleep schedule is essential for good sleep. Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. This can help regulate your body's internal clock and improve the quality of your sleep.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">2. Practice Yoga and Meditation</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Yoga and meditation can help reduce stress and promote relaxation, making it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep. Try practicing yoga or meditation for 10-20 minutes before bedtime to help you unwind and prepare for sleep.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">3. Use Herbs and Spices</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Certain herbs and spices, such as ashwagandha, brahmi, and valerian root, have calming properties that can help promote sleep. You can take these herbs as supplements or drink them as tea before bedtime.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">4. Try Aromatherapy</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Aromatherapy can help create a calming and relaxing environment that promotes sleep. Try using essential oils, such as lavender, chamomile, or sandalwood, in a diffuser or as a massage oil before bedtime.

        A warm oil massage, or abhyanga, can help relax your muscles and promote a sense of calm and relaxation. Try massaging your feet, hands, and scalp with warm sesame or coconut oil before bedtime.
